# Django Project README

This repository contains a Django project that you can use as a starting point for your web application. Below are the instructions on how to set up and run the project.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
- `pip` package manager. It usually comes with Python. If not, you can install it separately.

### Setting Up the Virtual Environment

It is recommended to use a virtual environment to manage the project dependencies.

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Create a virtual environment:
   
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv myenv
   ```

   Replace `myenv` with the desired name of your virtual environment.

3. Activate the virtual environment:

   - On Windows:

     ```bash
     myenv\Scripts\activate
     ```

   - On macOS and Linux:

     ```bash
     source myenv/bin/activate
     ```

### Installing Dependencies

With your virtual environment activated, you can now install the project dependencies.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This command will install all the necessary packages specified in the `requirements.txt` file.

## Running the Django Project

1. Make sure your virtual environment is activated.

2. Navigate to the project directory.

3. Apply the migrations:

   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

4. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

   This will start the server locally.

5. Open a web browser and go to [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) to view the project.
